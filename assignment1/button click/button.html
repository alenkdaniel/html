    <h1>paragraph</h1>

    <p id="para1">A paragraph usually contains more than one sentence and it is usually about one topic. The first
        sentence in a paragraph is sometimes called the key or topic sentence because it gives us the key to what the
        paragraph will be about. The other sentences usually relate to the key sentence.</p>
